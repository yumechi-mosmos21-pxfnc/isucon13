# * Fine Tuning

# * Logging and Replication
#

# As of 5.1 you can enable the log at runtime!
# general_log は最後に消しましょう

# Here you can see queries with especially long duration

# The following can be used as easy to replay backup logs or for replication.
# note: if you are setting up a replication slave, see README.Debian about
#       other settings you may need to change.

# * Security Features
#

# Read the manual, too, if you want chroot!

# For generating SSL certificates I recommend the OpenSSL GUI "tinyca".
